> "I am because we are." — The Wisdom of Ubuntu

Ubuntu is about **community**, **connection**, and **sharing**. This project reflects that philosophy by creating a respectful tool that fetches images from the internet and saves them in an organized way for everyone to enjoy.

---

## 📌 Project Description

**Ubuntu Image Fetcher** is a simple Python script that allows you to:

- Enter one or more image URLs
- Download the images from the web
- Save them into a local folder called `Fetched_Images`
- Handle errors gracefully and respectfully

It’s built with the spirit of Ubuntu — connecting people and resources across the web.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Easy-to-use input for single or multiple image URLs  
✅ Automatically creates a `Fetched_Images` folder if it doesn't exist  
✅ Checks that the content is a real image before saving  
✅ Gracefully handles connection problems and invalid links  
✅ Saves images using the original file name from the URL (or a default name)
